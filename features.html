          <p>She believes all it takes to make it is to stand up and take a stance in what you believe."For me, the question is, “Is this something worth fighting for?” And my “worth it” equation includes how much it means to me, how much of a difference I can make, what the range of consequences might be, and whether I will experience regret later on.In fact, I think that standing for something is really the only way to be truly effective in the long run. Standing against means working to destroy, while standing for means working to create."</p>

          <h2>Veronica Wright X Airmax</h2>
          <img src= "images/pinkgirl2.jpg" align="center" height="250px">
          <p> Veronica caputures the beauty in the streets we all fail to see. Street photography is one of the most challenging, but at the same time one of the most rewarding genres of photography. Documenting people in their everyday environment is not easy – it requires patience, hard work and sometimes even some bravery to be able to approach and photograph complete strangers.</p>
          <img src= "images/street.jpg" align="center" height="250px">

         <p>Her go to kicks are the Nike Airmax beacuase they keep her light on her feet in these concrete streets. The shoe was originally designed by Tinker Hatfield, who started out working for Nike as an architect designing shops, and is also one of her favorite creative success stories. </p>
         <img src = "images/airmax.jpg" align="center" width="200">
         <p> She credits self love to her amazing journey. "Self-love is a popular term today that gets tossed around in normal conversation. You have to love yourself more. Why don't you love yourself? If you only loved yourself, this wouldn't have happened to you. You can't love another person until you love yourself first." These are just a few of the self-love directives that we give or get to suggest a way to more living fulfillment. Self-love is important to living well. It influences who you pick for a mate, the image you project at work, and how you cope with the problems in your life. It is so important to your welfare that I want you to know how to bring more of it into your life."</p>
         <img src = "images/love.jpg" align="center" width="200">
         <h3>Seven-Step Prescription for Self-Love.</h3>
         <ul> 
         <li>1. Become mindful. </li>
         <li>2. Act on what you need rather than what you want. You love yourself when you can turn away from something that feels good and exciting to what you need to stay strong, centered, and moving forward in your life, instead.</li>
         <li>3. Practice good self-care. </li>
         <li>4. Set boundaries. </li>
         <li>5. Protect yourself. Bring the right people into your life.</li>
         <li>6. Forgive yourself. We humans can be so hard on ourselves. The downside of taking responsiblity for our actions is punishing ourselves too much for mistakes in learning and growing. </li>
         <li>7. Live intentionally. You will accept and love yourself more, whatever is happening in your life, when you live with purpose and design. Your purpose doesn't have to be crystal clear to you. If your intention is to live a meaningful and healthy life, you will make decisions that support this intention, and feel good about yourself when you succeed in this purpose.</li>
